  <p class="lead">
    I've always embraced the information age, having fallen in love with technology as a kid. Whether it was computers, video games, or any of the electronics I could find, I became more and more engrossed as technology evolved throughout my life. After going the self taught route of programming, I decided to attend a coding bootcamp. Here we are today - I program everyday and learn more each time. I love it.
